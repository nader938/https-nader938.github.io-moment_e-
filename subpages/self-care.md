## What to Read
Most mental health experts agree on the need for us to adopt good psychological hygiene. This consists of habits that give us balance and a sense of well-being in our day-to-day lives. It also enables us to get the most out of treatment and to maintain our treatment gains.
1. **Cover our basic needs:**
  - Eat well and regularly. Stay hydrated.
  - Try to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night.
2. **Set achievable goals so we do not become disheartened.**<br/>We don't have to abandon our dreams, but we do need to manage our expectations and those of others.
3. **Feed your social life.**<br/>As human beings we are sociable by nature and we need to interact with others to have fun and share our concerns. OCD not only tends to isolate us but also tends to breed in isolation.
4. **Exercise regularly.**<br/>Regular exercise helps, not just to keep us physically fit but also with regulating our emotions.

As you take charge of treating OCD, be sure to follow these psychological hygiene habits consistently (but not rigidly).
