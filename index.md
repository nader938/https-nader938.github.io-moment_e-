  - You will complete questionnaires about your demographic information and thoughts, feelings and behaviors through the smartphone app by clicking on the “EMA” setting.
  - You will also complete a short task measuring your attention by clicking on the “Flanker” setting in the app.
  - Next, you will watch videos in the app that provide information on OCD and a self-help guide for treatment.

  - Once a day, you will receive a phone notification through the app prompting you to:
    1. Review instructions for conducting treatment activities.
